## 📊 Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Here are some stack implementations to explore

- [Stack 1](https://github.com/Noppadol35/Data-Structure-Kmutnb/blob/main/Stack.cpp) : Check charector ( ) match in input 

- [Stack 2](https://github.com/Noppadol35/Data-Structure-Kmutnb/blob/main/Stack2.cpp) : Develop Stack which consists of functions as follows There are several commands in this program

  

## 🚶🏻 Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Below is a queue implementation

- [Queue 1](https://github.com/Noppadol35/Data-Structure-Kmutnb/blob/main/Queue.cpp) : Develop Queue which consists of functions as follows There are several commands in this program.

  

## 🔗 Link list
Linked lists are dynamic data structures consisting of nodes connected via pointers. Here is a simple linked list implementation

- [Link list 1](https://github.com/Noppadol35/Data-Structure-Kmutnb/blob/main/Link-List-1.cpp) : Develop linked List which consists of functions as follows

  

## 🔑 Hash
Hash tables are data structures that map keys to values using a hash function. Here’s a basic implementation

- [Hash 1](https://github.com/Noppadol35/Data-Structure-Kmutnb/blob/main/HashTable.cpp) : Develop Hash table using Separate Chaining which has following functions
