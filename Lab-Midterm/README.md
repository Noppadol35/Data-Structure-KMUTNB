# LAB-Midterm

### Overview

This project consists of two key programming tasks focused on fundamental data structures: Stack, Queue, and Link. Each task demonstrates the implementation of these structures in real-world scenarios, such as process scheduling in operating systems and matching parentheses in strings.

### Topics Covered
- **LAB1**: Process Scheduling Algorithm using LIFO
- **LAB2**: Parenthesis Matching using Stack

## [LAB1](https://github.com/Noppadol35/Data-Structure-KMUTNB/blob/main/Lab-Midterm/LAB1.md): **Process Scheduling Algorithm using LIFO**

### **Description**
In this lab, we developed a process scheduling algorithm using the **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** concept. The program simulates how an operating system selects processes to execute based on the following attributes

- **Process ID (PID)**: A unique identifier for each process.
- **Arrival Time (A)**: The time at which a process arrives in the queue.
- **Service Time (T)**: The time required to complete the process.

## [**LAB2](https://github.com/Noppadol35/Data-Structure-KMUTNB/blob/main/Lab-Midterm/LAB2.md): Parenthesis Matching using Stack**

### **Description**
This lab involves developing a parenthesis matching program using a **Stack** data structure. The program validates strings containing different types of brackets, including

- **Round brackets: ( )**
- **Square brackets: [ ]**
- **Curly brackets: { }**
- **Angle brackets: <> and << >> (specific case)**


## **Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**
-  A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) or any compatible programming environment.
- Basic knowledge of stacks, queues, and process scheduling concepts.
